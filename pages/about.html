                    Create and gather content and resources that
                    <strong>increase developer understanding, happiness and productivity.</strong>

                <h2>Manifesto</h2>
                <h3>Augment developer understanding and thus happiness</h3>
                <blockquote cite="https://quotecatalog.com/quote/lauren-oliver-you-cant-be-ha-L1Nxxrp">You can't be
                    happy unless you're unhappy sometimes. - Lauren Oliver
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    Building software will never be an easy task. Furthermore, unhappiness grows exponentially with
                    the complexity of your project. There are no magical rules or principles to stick to, but I can
                    recommend you to always write as little code as possible, try to solve the problems as fast as
                    you can and, of course, now and then take your time to refactor your code. Don't forget that
                    good code should be self explanatory.
                </p>
                <h3>Expand developer knowledge beyond comfort and custom</h3>
                <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_instrument">If the only tool you have is a
                    hammer, it is tempting to treat everything as if it were a
                    nail. - Abraham Maslow
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    We all have that tool or programming language that we love and we want to solve every single problem
                    with it. Well, although it could be really funny, we shouldn't be limited by any narrow set of
                    ideas. Keep in mind to use the right tool for the each problem. It wouldn't be the first time that
                    today's best practices are tomorrow's anti-patterns.
                </p>
                <h3>Rescue developer from being drowned by the wave of hype</h3>
                <blockquote
                    cite="https://quotepark.com/quotes/1838250-alan-kay-computing-spread-out-much-much-faster-than-educat/">
                    "Computing spread out much, much faster than educating unsophisticated people can happen. In
                    the last 25 years or so, we actually got something like a pop culture, similar to what happened when
                    television came on the scene and some of its inventors thought it would be a way of getting
                    Shakespeare to the masses. But they forgot that you have to be more sophisticated and have more
                    perspective to understand Shakespeare. What television was able to do was to capture people as they
                    were. So I think the lack of a real computer science today, and the lack of real software
                    engineering today, is partly due to this pop culture. - Alan Kay"

                    Well, there's no much that I can add to that quote... While I'm writing this, I'm sure there is a
                    new
                    Javascript framework being pushed to Github. Always ask yourself
                    <em>is this the best toolfor this task?</em>
                    Just because it has a nice interface and is used by a well-known company
                    doesn't mean you need to use it. We tend to over-engineer almost everything. Don't forget the
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle" target="_blank">KISS</a> principle.
