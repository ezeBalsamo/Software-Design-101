                        Building software will never be an easy task. Furthermore, unhappiness grows exponentially with
                        the complexity of your project. There are no magical rules or principles to stick to, but I can
                        recommend you to always write as little code as possible, try to solve the problems as fast as
                        you can and, of course, now and then take your time to refactor your code. Don't forget that
                        good code should be self explanatory.

                        We all have that tool or programming language that we love and we want to solve every single
                        problem with it. Well, although it could be really funny, we shouldn't be limited by any narrow
                        set of ideas. Keep in mind to use the right tool for the each problem. It wouldn't be the first
                        time that today's best practices are tomorrow's anti-patterns.

                        Computing spread out much, much faster than educating unsophisticated people can happen. In
                        the last 25 years or so, we actually got something like a pop culture, similar to what happened
                        when television came on the scene and some of its inventors thought it would be a way of getting
                        Shakespeare to the masses. But they forgot that you have to be more sophisticated and have more
                        perspective to understand Shakespeare. What television was able to do was to capture people as
                        they were. So I think the lack of a real computer science today, and the lack of real software
                        engineering today, is partly due to this pop culture. - Alan Kay

                        Well, there's no much that I can add to that quote... While I'm writing this, I'm sure there is
                        a new Javascript framework being pushed to Github. Always ask yourself
                        <em>is this the best tool for this task?</em>
                        Just because it has a nice interface and is used by a well-known company
                        doesn't mean you need to use it. We tend to over-engineer almost everything. Don't forget the
