                <h2>Some tips for Junior Devs</h2>
                <h3>You can't know everything</h3>
                <p>
                    You are Junior. Your ride has just begun. Do you feel
                    like you have a lot to learn? Do you feel bad about
                    that? Give up that feeling. Don't you dare to compare
                    yourself with anyone. You're learning, you're building a
                    great developer in you and that will take time.
                </p>
                <h3>Be patience</h3>
                <p>
                    Do you remember that Guns N' Roses song? Yeah, a really
                    wonderful one. Talking seriously, are you trying to tell
                    me that you just started and you're already worried
                    about when you'll be a senior? You must be like a sponge
                    and absorb. Now, I'm asking you. What happens when you
                    squeeze a sponge? Weel, it loses what it absorbs. With
                    this I'm trying to tell you not to rush. Grow up at your
                    own pace.
                </p>
                <h3>Your opinion matters</h3>
                <p>
                    It happens to all of us. We are afraid of sharing our
                    opinion since we think we are going to say something
                    stupid. But, even if you say it, you will learn from it.
                    This is a collaborative work and the best way to learn
                    is to share our lines of thought with the others and to
                    discuss them.

                <h2>Music to develop and concentrate</h2>
                <p>
                    Recently, I was watching videos from
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/HolaMundoDev" target="_blank">Nico from Hola Mundo</a>
                    and he mentioned this playlist. So, I gave it a chance
                    and discover it was really neat. It's excellent for
                    concentrating in long term tasks. Also, it's free to
                    use. Say goodbye to been worried about copyright claims.
                </p>
