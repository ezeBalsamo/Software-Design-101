                <h2>Some tips for Junior Devs</h2>
                <div class="article__content">
                    <h3>ü§Ø You can't know everything</h3>
                    <p>
                        You are Junior. Your ride has just begun. Do you feel
                        like you have a lot to learn? Do you feel bad about
                        that? Give up that feeling. Don't you dare to compare
                        yourself with anyone. You're learning, you're building a
                        great developer in you and that will take time.
                    </p>
                    <h3>‚è≥Ô∏è Be patience</h3>
                    <p>
                        Do you remember that Guns N' Roses song? Yeah, a really
                        wonderful one. Talking seriously, are you trying to tell
                        me that you just started and you're already worried
                        about when you'll be a senior? You must be like a sponge
                        and absorb. Now, I'm asking you. What happens when you
                        squeeze a sponge? Weel, it loses what it absorbs. With
                        this I'm trying to tell you not to rush. Grow up at your
                        own pace.
                    </p>
                    <h3>ü§î Your opinion matters</h3>
                    <p>
                        It happens to all of us. We are afraid of sharing our
                        opinion since we think we are going to say something
                        stupid. But, even if you say it, you will learn from it.
                        This is a collaborative work and the best way to learn
                        is to share our lines of thought with the others and to
                        discuss them.

                <h2>Music to develop and concentrate</h2>
                <div class="article__content">
                    <p>
                        Recently, I was watching videos from
                        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/HolaMundoDev" target="_blank">Nico from Hola Mundo</a>
                        and he mentioned this playlist. So, I gave it a chance
                        and discover it was really neat. It's excellent for
                        concentrating in long term tasks. Also, it's free to
                        use. Say goodbye to been worried about copyright claims.
